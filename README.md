Abstract
--------

Depressions – inwardly-draining regions of digital elevation models – present
difficulties for terrain analysis and hydrological modeling. Analogous
"depressions" also arise in image processing and morphological segmentation
where they may represent noise, features of interest, or both. Here we provide a
new data structure – the depression hierarchy – that captures the full topologic
and topographic complexity of depressions in a region. We treat depressions as
networks, in a way that is analogous to surface-water flow paths, in which
individual sub-depressions merge together to form meta-depressions in a process
that continues until they begin to drain externally. The hierarchy can be used
to selectively fill or breach depressions, or to accelerate dynamic models of
hydrological flow. Complete, well-commented, open-source code and correctness
tests are available on Github and Zenodo.

Prerequisites
-------------

Although GDAL is not required to use the library, it is needed to run the
example program.

Install the prerequisites

### Linux

    sudo apt install libgdal-dev cmake

### Mac

    brew install gdal libomp cmake

Compilation
-----------

Ensure you have a working compiler.

The following compilers are known to work: GCC7.5.0, GCC8.4.0, GCC9.3.0

The following compilers are known to be too old: GCC5.4.0

Next, be sure to acquire submodules either upon initially obtaining the repository:

    git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/r-barnes/Barnes2019-DepressionHierarchy.git

Or afterwards by using the following within the repository itself:

    git submodule update --init --recursive

Afterwards, compile:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DUSE_GDAL=ON ..
    make -j 4 #Set to number of CPUs for a faster compilation

Run with:

    ./build/dephier.exe <Input> <Output Prefix> <Ocean Level>

`<INPUT>` can be any file that GDAL can read.

`<Output Prefix>` is a name such as `temp/out` which is used to prefix the
following output files:

 * `temp/out-label.tif`: A file showing the depression hierarchy leaf label of each cell in the DEM
 * `temp/out-graph.csv`: A CSV file showing the topological relationships of the depression hierarchy's depressions

`<Ocean Level>` is the elevation of the ocean within the dataset All cells having this elevation are considered to be part of the ocean.
